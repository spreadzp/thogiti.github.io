# Overview

We will implement dot product of two vectors of size `N` using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) in Circom, Halo2, Noir. According to [k12.libretexts.org](https://k12.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Mathematics/Precalculus/07%3A_Vectors/7.04%3A_Dot_Product_and_Angle_Between_Two_Vectors), the dot product of two vectors `A` and `B` of size `N` is given by:

```
A.B = a1*b1 + a2*b2 + ... + aN*bN
```

# [Circom Circuit for Dotproduct of Two Vectors](#circom-circuit-for-dotproduct-of-two-vectors)
In this example we will investigate how to write a Circom circuit for the dotproduct of two vectors, create a Zero Knowledge Proof and verify the proof with zero knowledge.

## [Circom Setup and Installation](#circom-setup-and-installation)

The complete and latest documentation for installing the Circom ecosystem can be found [here](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/). The older versions of Circom can be also installed from the [old circom repository](https://github.com/iden3/circom_old).


### [Circom Install dependencies](#circom-install-dependencies)

The Circom compiler is written in Rust. To have Rust available in your system, you can install `rustup`. If youâ€™re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following command:
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

You also need the latest version of `Node.js` (or `yarn`). You can install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### [Install Circom](#install-circom)
First, clone the circom repository: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/iden3/circom.git
```

Enter the circom directory and use the cargo build to compile:
```shell
cargo build --release
```

The installation takes around 3 minutes to be completed. When the command successfully finishes, it generates the circom binary in the directory `target/release`. You can install this binary as follows:
```shell
cargo install --path circom
```

The previous command will install the circom binary in the directory `$HOME/.cargo/bin`. 

### [Install Snarkjs](#install-snarkjs) 

You can install `snarkjs` with the following command:
```shell
npm install -g snarkjs
```


## [Implementing Circom Circuit for the Dotproduct of Two Vectors](#implementing-circom-circuit-for-the-dotproduct-of-two-vectors)

To implement the dotproduct of two vectors in Circom, we can follow the steps below:

1. Define the two vectors `A` and `B` of size `N`.
2. Define a variable to store the dot product.
3. Calculate the dot product by multiplying the corresponding components of `A` and `B` and adding them together.
4. Output the dot product.

Here's what the code would look like in Circom:

```circom

template DotProduct(N: number) {
    signal A[N];
    signal B[N];
    signal result;

    component multiply[N];
    component add[N-1];

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        multiply[i] A[i] * B[i] -> add[i];
    }

    for (i = 0; i < N-1; i++) {
        add[i] + add[i+1] -> add[i+1];
    }

    add[N-2] -> result;
}

```

In the above code, we define two input signals `A` and `B` of size `N`, which represent the two vectors. We also define an output signal `result`, which will store the dot product.

We then define two components, `multiply` and `add`. The `multiply` component multiplies the corresponding components of `A` and `B`, while the `add` component adds them together. We use a loop to connect the outputs of the `multiply` components to the inputs of the `add` components. We also use a loop to connect the outputs of the `add` components to each other, until we reach the final output signal `result`.

To use this template, we can simply instantiate it and provide values for the `A` and `B` signals:

```circom

template Main() {
    signal A[4] = [3, -5, 4, 2];
    signal B[4] = [2, 6, 5, 1];
    signal result;

    DotProduct(4)()
        .A(A)
        .B(B)
        .result(result);

    print(result);
}

```

In the above code, we define the two input signals `A` and `B` of size `4`, and an output signal `result`. We then instantiate the `DotProduct` template with a size of `4`, and connect its `A` and `B` signals to the corresponding input signals. We also connect its `result` signal to our output signal. Finally, we print the `result` signal.

In this example we will investigate how to write a Halo2 circuit for the dotproduct of two vectors, create a Zero Knowledge Proof and verify the proof with zero knowledge.


## [Halo2 Setup and Installation](#halo2-setup-and-installation)

Halo2 requires the latest Rust. You can find more about developing using Halo2 at the official [halo2 documentation](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/index.html).

## [Implementing Halo2 Circuit for the Dotproduct of Two Vectors](#implementing-halo2-circuit-for-the-dotproduct-of-two-vectors)

To implement the dotproduct of two vectors in Halo2, we first need to define our circuit in Halo2. Here is the code for this:

```rust

use halo2::{
    circuit::{Layouter, SimpleFloorPlanner},
    plonk::{Circuit, ConstraintSystem, Error},
    poly::Rotation,
};

// Define the circuit struct
#[derive(Debug)]
struct DotProduct<'a> {
    a: &'a [u64],
    b: &'a [u64],
    result: &'a mut [u64],
}

// Implement the Circuit trait for our circuit
impl<'a> Circuit<SimpleFloorPlanner> for DotProduct<'a> {
    type Config = ();
    type FloorPlanner = SimpleFloorPlanner;

    fn without_witnesses(&self) -> Self {
        DotProduct {
            a: self.a,
            b: self.b,
            result: &mut [0; N],
        }
    }

    fn configure(
        _config: Self::Config,
        meta: &mut ConstraintSystem<SimpleFloorPlanner>,
    ) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Define the input signals A and B
        let a = meta.advice_column();
        let b = meta.advice_column();

        // Define the intermediate signals for multiplication
        let mul = (0..N)
            .map(|_| meta.advice_column())
            .collect::<Vec<_>>();

        // Define the intermediate signals for addition
        let add = (0..N - 1)
            .map(|_| meta.advice_column())
            .collect::<Vec<_>>();

        // Define the output signal result
        let result = meta.advice_column();

        // Constrain the input signals to the values provided
        for (i, &value) in self.a.iter().enumerate() {
            meta.enable_constant(a[i], value.into())?;
        }
        for (i, &value) in self.b.iter().enumerate() {
            meta.enable_constant(b[i], value.into())?;
        }

        // Constrain the multiplication signals to the product 
        // of the corresponding components of A and B
        for i in 0..N {
            meta.multiply(
                Rotation::prev(),
                &[a[i], b[i]],
                mul[i],
            )?;
        }

        // Constrain the addition signals to the sum of the 
        // corresponding multiplication signals
        for i in 0..N - 1 {
            meta.add(
                Rotation::cur(),
                &[mul[i], mul[i + 1]],
                add[i],
            )?;
        }

        // Constrain the output signal to the last addition signal
        meta.copy(
            Rotation::cur(),
            add[N - 2],
            result,
        )?;

        // Constrain the output signal to the value provided
        for (i, &value) in self.result.iter().enumerate() {
            meta.constrain_equal(result, value.into())?;
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}

```

In this code, we define our circuit struct `DotProduct`, which contains the input signals `a` and `b`, and an output signal `result`. We also implement the `Circuit` trait for our circuit, which defines how the circuit should be constructed and constrained.

We define the input signals `a` and `b` using `meta.advice_column()`, which creates a new advice column in the circuit. We also define the intermediate signals `mul` and `add`, which will be used to perform the multiplication and addition operations. Finally, we define the output signal `result`.

We constrain the input signals to the values provided using `meta.enable_constant()`, which constrains the advice column to a constant value. We then constrain the multiplication signals using `meta.multiply()`, which constrains the product of the corresponding components of `a` and `b` to the corresponding multiplication signal. We then constrain the addition signals using `meta.add()`, which constrains the sum of the corresponding multiplication signals to the corresponding addition signal. Finally, we constrain the output signal to the last addition signal using `meta.copy()`, and constrain it to the value provided using `meta.constrain_equal()`.

To use this circuit, we can instantiate it with the values for `a` and `b`, and an empty vector for `result`. We can then create a proof using ` Prover::prove() `, and verify the proof using ` Verifier::verify() `. Here's an example:


```rust

use halo2::{
    dev::MockProver,
    plonk::{Circuit, ConstraintSystem, Verifier},
};

// Define the size of our vectors
const N: usize = 4;

// Define our main function
fn main() {
    // Define the input signals A and B
    let a = [3, 5, 4, 2];
    let b = [2, 6, 5, 1];

    // Define the output signal result
    let mut result = [0; N];

    // Instantiate the circuit
    let circuit = DotProduct {
        a: &a,
        b: &b,
        result: &mut result,
    };

    // Create a proof
    let prover = MockProver::run(N, &circuit, vec![]).unwrap();
    let proof = prover.proof;

    // Verify the proof
    let verifier = Verifier::new(N, &circuit, &proof).unwrap();
    assert!(verifier.verify().is_ok());

    // Print the result
    println!("{:?}", result);
}

```

In this code, we define the input signals `a` and `b` and the output signal `result`. We then instantiate the `DotProduct` circuit with these values. We create a proof using `MockProver::run()`, which simulates the circuit execution and generates a proof. We then verify the proof using `Verifier::new()` and `verify()`. Finally, we print the `result`.

Note that in this example, we use `MockProver` to generate a proof and verify it. In a real-world application, we would use a trusted setup to generate the proving and verifying keys, and use those keys to generate and verify proofs. We would also need to ensure that the inputs and outputs of the circuit are properly encrypted and decrypted to prevent information leakage. However, these details are beyond the scope of this example.

## [What is a trusted setup and why is it necessary in a real-world application?](#what-is-a-trusted-setup-and-why-is-it-necessary-in-a-real-world-application)

A trusted setup is a process used in some zero-knowledge proof systems, including Halo2, to generate the proving and verifying keys that are used to generate and verify proofs. The trusted setup involves a group of trusted individuals or entities who collectively generate and destroy a secret value that is used to generate the keys. The secret value is destroyed after the keys are generated, so that no one can learn it and use it to generate fake proofs.

The trusted setup is necessary in a real-world application because it ensures that the proving and verifying keys are generated in a way that is secure and unbiased. Without a trusted setup, an attacker could potentially generate their own keys and use them to generate fake proofs that are accepted by the system. The trusted setup ensures that the keys are generated in a way that is independent of the attacker, and that the attacker cannot learn the secret value used to generate the keys.

In Halo2, the trusted setup involves generating a random permutation of the circuit's columns, and using this permutation to generate the keys. The permutation is generated using a multiparty computation protocol, where each participant contributes a random value that is combined to generate the final permutation. The permutation ensures that the circuit's columns are mixed together in a way that prevents an attacker from learning anything about the circuit by observing the keys.

Once the trusted setup is complete, the proving and verifying keys are distributed to the users of the system, who can use them to generate and verify proofs. The users do not need to trust each other or the system, because the keys were generated in a way that is secure and unbiased. However, the users must ensure that the inputs and outputs of the circuit are properly encrypted and decrypted, to prevent information leakage.

In summary, a trusted setup is a process used to generate the proving and verifying keys for a zero-knowledge proof system, and is necessary in a real-world application to ensure that the keys are generated in a way that is secure and unbiased.
